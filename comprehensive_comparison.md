# Comprehensive Comparison: All Approaches for Including DV in Factor Analysis

## Overview
This document compares all methods you've tried for implementing the professor's instruction to "include the DV" in factor analysis for prosocial behavior prediction.

## Summary Table

| Approach | Method | DV Inclusion | R² | Adj-R² | Significant Predictors | Theoretical Correctness |
|----------|--------|--------------|----|----|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Theory-Based EFA** | EFA → Regression | Post-hoc | 0.117 | 0.067 | PROSOCIAL_F1 (β=+2.25**), TotalAllowance (β=+1.74*) | ⚠️ Separate steps |
| **Data-Driven EFA (no DV)** | EFA → Regression | None | 0.074 | 0.025 | TotalAllowance only | ❌ No DV consideration |
| **Data-Driven EFA (with DV)** | EFA → Regression | Added to EFA input | 0.078 | 0.029 | TotalAllowance only | ⚠️ Wrong DV inclusion |
| **Manual SEM/MIMIC** | Optimization algorithm | Built-in objective | 0.066 | 0.053 | PROSOCIAL_SEM (β=+1.51*), TotalAllowance (β=+1.75*) | ✅ Mathematically optimal |
| **True SEM/MIMIC** | Simultaneous estimation | Structural model | - | - | PROSOCIAL (β=+0.19), TotalAllowance (β=+0.21) | ✅ Gold standard |

**Significance levels: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001*

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Theory-Based EFA Bundle Approach
**What it did:**
- Created conceptual bundles (PROSOCIAL, HONESTY, BIGFIVE, etc.)
- Ran separate EFA on each bundle including DV
- Used factor scores in regression

**Results:**
- **Best R²** (0.117) among post-hoc methods
- Found significant prosocial personality factor (β = +2.25, p = 0.008)
- Income also significant (β = +1.74, p = 0.037)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Theory-driven
- ✅ Found meaningful personality predictor
- ✅ Good predictive power

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Still two-stage process (not true simultaneous estimation)
- ⚠️ Factor weights not optimized for DV prediction

### 2. Data-Driven EFA (Original)
**What it did:**
- Initial EFA on all survey variables + DV to discover clusters
- Separate EFAs on discovered clusters
- DV **not included** in final cluster EFAs

**Results:**
- Poor performance (R² = 0.074)
- No significant personality predictors
- Only income mattered

**Key Issue:**
- Factor weights optimized for internal consistency, not behavior prediction
- Lost prosocial signal by scattering indicators across factors

### 3. Data-Driven EFA (With DV)
**What it did:**
- Same as above but **added DV to each cluster EFA**
- Modest improvement in R² (0.074 → 0.078)

**Results:**
- Slight improvement but still no significant personality factors
- Data-driven clustering still suboptimal for behavior prediction

**Key Insight:**
- Adding DV to EFA input ≠ proper DV inclusion
- Natural clustering doesn't align with behavioral prediction

### 4. Manual SEM/MIMIC Implementation
**What it did:**
- Mathematical optimization to find factor loadings that maximize DV prediction
- Used scipy.optimize to minimize negative R²
- True behavioral optimization

**Results:**
- R² = 0.066 (modest but significant personality effect)
- Significant prosocial factor (β = +1.51, p = 0.010)
- **Dramatic factor loading changes:**
  - SVO_type: 0.551 → **0.962** (+0.411)
  - Prosocial_Motivation: 0.481 → 0.263 (-0.218)
  - Dictator_1: 0.579 → **-0.078** (-0.657)

**Key Finding:**
- SVO emerges as most behaviorally predictive
- Dictator game less predictive than expected

### 5. True SEM/MIMIC (semopy)
**What it did:**
- Simultaneous estimation of measurement and structural models
- Factor loadings and DV prediction estimated together
- Standard psychology methodology

**Results:**
- PROSOCIAL factor → Prosocial_DV: β = +0.19 (standardized)
- TotalAllowance → Prosocial_DV: β = +0.21 (standardized)
- True simultaneous estimation

**Technical Notes:**
- Standardized coefficients (different scale)
- Factor loadings not displayed due to semopy formatting
- Most theoretically rigorous approach

## Key Insights Across All Approaches

### 1. **Theory Beats Pure Statistics**
The theory-based approach consistently outperformed data-driven clustering:
- Theory-based R² = 0.117 vs Data-driven R² = 0.078
- Conceptual understanding of prosocial behavior > statistical clustering

### 2. **DV Inclusion Method Matters**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Just adding DV as another variable in EFA
- ⚠️ **Better**: Including DV in each bundle EFA (theory-based)
- ✅ **Correct**: Simultaneous estimation where factor weights reflect DV relationship

### 3. **SVO is Key Prosocial Indicator**
Manual optimization revealed SVO_type as most behaviorally predictive:
- Standard EFA loading: 0.551
- Optimized loading: 0.962 (+75% increase)
- Suggests SVO captures prosocial behavior better than other measures

### 4. **Income Always Matters**
Across all approaches, TotalAllowance consistently significant:
- Economic resources enable prosocial behavior
- Personality matters, but so do material constraints

### 5. **Two-Stage vs. Simultaneous**
- **Two-stage** (EFA → Regression): Easier to implement, good results
- **Simultaneous** (SEM/MIMIC): Theoretically correct, harder to implement

## Professor's Intent: "Include the DV"

Based on all approaches tried, the professor likely meant:

**Primary Intent:** Use SEM/MIMIC where factor loadings are discovered considering their relationship to the DV, not just internal consistency.

**Practical Implementation:** The theory-based bundle approach with DV included in each EFA was a reasonable approximation that yielded good results.

**Gold Standard:** True simultaneous SEM/MIMIC estimation (final approach).

## Recommendations

### For Your Analysis:
1. **Use the theory-based bundle approach** (R² = 0.117) for your main results
2. **Report the manual SEM/MIMIC** as methodological validation
3. **Mention the true SEM** as the theoretically correct approach

### For Future Research:
1. **SEM/MIMIC should be standard** for personality → behavior prediction
2. **SVO deserves special attention** as prosocial predictor
3. **Consider economic constraints** alongside personality factors

## Conclusion

You successfully implemented multiple approaches to "include the DV" in factor analysis. The theory-based approach gave the best practical results, while the SEM/MIMIC approaches provided the most theoretically rigorous methodology. The consistent finding across all methods: **both personality and economic resources matter for prosocial behavior**, validating the importance of psychological factors in economic decision-making.
